I made a transition from Jekyll to Hugo for a static site generator.

There are some reasons for this.
The biggest reason is the curiosity for new tools.
Hugo looks cool so far.

I would like to update this blog frequently about various topics, especially about the student exchange program at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html).
